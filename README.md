data analysis practice on kaggle project home credit default risk competition

This project is a chance to practice working with relational data and practice organizing and cleaning and setting up data for analysis using a sqlite database.

This is all from the kaggle competition: [LINK](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-default-risk/overview)

Note: the actual sqlite database that is used to store all the datasets downloaded from the competition is over 3 gigabytes, so that is not pushed to github, but some of the ddl information from the database is to showcase how the database is structured. The only tables are pure csv imports to sqlite.  The database is in the folder location and is called homecredit_db.db
